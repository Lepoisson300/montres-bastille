Ultra-realistic product photograph, studio lighting, straight top-down view, camera angle fixed (0° yaw, 0° pitch), lens equivalent 85mm, sharp detail, neutral gradient background (very dark slate to slightly lighter vignette). Output exact canvas 4000x4000 px, sRGB. DO NOT add logos, text, props, or watermark. Align object centered. Deliver transparent PNG (alpha) where only the described component is visible.

(chose a component)

Render only a soft shadow layer matching the watch silhouette (very slight feathered edges). Neutral grey, semi-transparent mask. Transparent PNG, 4000x4000. This will sit below all parts.


case

Render only the stainless steel 40 mm watch case (bezel + midcase + lugs) with brushed flank and polished bezel. No dial, no hands, no strap, no crystal. Keep subtle specular highlights consistent with studio key light at camera-right ~2 o'clock and a faint rim from 10 o'clock. Transparent PNG, 4000x4000, exact anchor point and scale so case lines up with other layers.


dial

Render only the navy-blue sunburst dial (no case ring). Include silver hour indices and subtle minute track. No hands, no case, no strap, no crystal. Subtle radial specular for sunburst effect. Transparent PNG, 4000x4000, perfectly centered to match case aperture.

hands

Render only the set of sword-shaped hour, minute, and seconds hands, polished steel. Include correct stacking order and center hole position. No dial, no case, no strap, no crystal. Transparent PNG, 4000x4000, centered so hands align with dial center.


straps

Render only the tan calf leather strap (both ends) laid flat to match watch lug positions. Include stitched edges and polished buckle. No case, no dial, no hands. Transparent PNG, 4000x4000, centered and aligned to the case lugs area.


crystal

Render only the sapphire crystal overlay, transparent, slight specular highlight. No case, no dial, no hands, no strap. Transparent PNG, 4000x4000, centered to match case diameter.
